# AQI-Analysis
This is a data preprocessing &amp; data visualisation project.
The data for this project is taken from kaggle(by saketh ramanujan)

There is more than a pseudo code but less than complete code here. Preprocessing file contains something sort of a prototype which'll have details of how to do things.
Same goes for Plotting file.
There are multiple datafiles and each file requires different type of work. 
The data provided here contains cleaned files. For someone who is acquiring that data will have two things to do i.e.
1) Feature Selection
2) Data Visualization
Some cities have multiple data files from different stations, a user is free to deal with them as he/she deems fit.
A merged file is also present in case Data Visulaization is the only aim.
